# Exponential ergodicity of mirror-Langevin diffusions

This repository is the official implementation of [Exponential ergodicity of mirror-Langevin diffusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09669), and in particular for the Newton Langevin Algorithm. 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Sampling 

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation 

To evaluate samples,

```eval
